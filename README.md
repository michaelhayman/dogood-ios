Do Good iOS App
======

Introduction
---

Welcome to the repository for the Do Good iOS App.

Do Good is a not-for-profit organization which seeks to increase the amount
of social good in the world by making people more aware of opportunities
available near them and by rewarding people for doing socially responsible
and honorable things.  In turn it is hoped this will inspire more people to do good.

It consists of a Web site, an iOS app and an API.  It was written over a
period from June 2013 to July 2014.  Recently the app was updated with more test
coverage and to fix a few changes that came with the iOS 8 SDK, notably
around location permissions.

Installation instructions
---

1. Clone the repository and go to it in the terminal
2. Install cocoapods by running `gem install cocoapods`
3. Run `pod install`
4. Open `DoGood.xcworkspace`
5. Verify that the app runs in the simulator

Test coverage
---

The following classes have close to 100% test coverage for demonstration purposes:

- `DGGoodCommentsViewController`
- `DGComment`
- `CommentCell`
- `DGExploreCategoriesViewController`
- `DGLocator`
- `GoodTableView`
- `NoResultsCell`

Models are also tested.

Test coverage for the rest of the app is a work-in-progress.

Feel free to submit a pull request with tests for existing code.

Press `âŒ˜+u` to run the test suite after the app has been set up in Xcode.

Test methodology
---

The following packages are used for testing:

- XCTest is the testing framework provided by Xcode 5+;
- OCMock is a stub and mocking library;
- OHHTTPStub replaces network requests at the Cocoa level to allow for a
  minimum amount of method-based stubbing;
- KIF tests the user interface with acceptance tests (coming soon)

The tests have been kept simple for maintainability.
As such a minimum of testing packages are used (in contrast with a lot of test packages
like Specta, Kiwi, etc, which are better suited to larger teams of developers).
