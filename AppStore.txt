Description:
Reward good people and find good things to do with Do Good.

Ever seen someone do something good and wished you could get them the recognition they deserve? Now you can. Nominate them on Do Good to give them points which they can redeem for personal rewards or donations to do even more good.

You can also use the app to find inspiration to Do Good yourself.  Whether it's helping an elderly person across the street, cleaning up a local park, or giving blood, you can share the 'do good' feeling with everyone in your community.

Share, reward, encourage and compete with your friends to Do Good!


You can use the app to:

* Nominate and reward good deeds

* Post & get help from the community for social projects and initiatives

* Participate in good things happening near you in education, health, the environment and more

* Follow and connect with people and organizations involved in the community


Get the app, find an opportunity, then get out there and Do Good.  You may just get nominated too!
